# Object Detection Project

## Project Description
This project uses the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for object detection. The model is capable of detecting objects in images and drawing bounding boxes around them.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.7 or later
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Files
- `object_detection.py`: This is the main script that performs object detection.

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install opencv-python numpy`
3. Download the YOLO weights and cfg file from the official YOLO website and place them in the same directory as the script.
4. Run the script with a command like `python object_detection.py`.

## Usage
Replace `"image.jpg"` in the script with the path to the image you want to detect objects in. The script will display the image with bounding boxes around detected objects. Press any key to close the window.
